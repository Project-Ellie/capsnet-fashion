## Principles and Patterns for ML Practitioners

##### By Wolfgang Giersche, ZÃ¼hlke Engineering AG

#### S.O.L.I.D (and more) principles applied to Tensorflow programming

##### I am using the most current TF API 1.8.0 with the following building blocks:


The content here is heavily inspired by the 
[github tensorflow repo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official/mnist) - 
indeed initially copied, and then significantly refactored to demonstrate how SWE patterns and principles 
make the code more readable, testable and reusable.



- [Tensorflow Dataset API](https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/datasets)
    - Allows for pre-processing with a monadic API (map, flatmap, etc)
    - Preprocessing may even happen in parallel streaming fashion
    
- [Estimator API](https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/estimators)
    - very convenient highlevel API
    - Checkpointing and recovery 
    - Tensorboard summaries
    - much more...
- [Multi-GPU Training of contrib.estimator package](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/estimator/)
    - convenient wrapper to distribute training on any number of GPUs on a single machine
    - works by means of synchonous gradient averaging over parallel mini-batches

This tutorial is based on  [Google's official TF example](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official/mnist)
using [Zalando Research's Fashion Dataset](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist)
instead of the typical [Handwritten Digits](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).

The [S.O.L.I.D. Principles](http://www.cvc.uab.es/shared/teach/a21291/temes/object_oriented_design/materials_adicionals/principles_and_patterns.pdf) 
are commonly attributed to [Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob)](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cecil_Martin).

Exactly because data analytics and machine learning have rather exploratory traits, 
practices should better support code and config changes without endangering 
the quality of the code.
